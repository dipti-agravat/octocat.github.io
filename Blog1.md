When asked to define an organization’s culture, the unmonitored actions of its workforce and the mindset they carry come to the forefront. As a leading firm in the IT-sphere, Radixweb attributes its successes to its people. Each individual, as the lifeblood of the organization, brings a unique set of skills to the table. This uniqueness, this individuality, is what makes up the core of Radixweb.

For over the past two decades, Radixweb has nurtured a sense of belonging amongst our people. Deeply committed to nurturing a culture of inclusion across racial, generational, and gender biases, Radixweb celebrates diversity and inclusion in all its numerous forms.

Radixweb has consistently strived to be an organization where an employee can be their authentic self; a place where he is appreciated for his uniqueness, without the fear of being judged or ostracized.

The foundation of our culture rests on the points that follow.


### Appreciation for Diversity

Diversity is inherently diverse. It could pertain to race, gender, or generation, but the underlying ethos is that diversity does not segregate but instead integrates differences to create an amalgamation that brings out the best in every individual.

Diversity could also be measured in terms of skillsets, which is why Radixweb has a strong upskilling/cross-skilling program that allows employees to break departmental silos and function in a cohesive, collaborative way.

Radixweb has a no-door policy and a flat hierarchy where everyone is welcome to speak up and rest assured that they are heard, their viewpoint is appreciated, and their opinions matter.

Our team is committed to building every employee into a visionary leader who can look beyond presumptions and biases to clearly understand ‘who’ the person in front of him actually is.

Radixweb believes in building a meritocracy where achievements matter, not race or gender. What takes the forefront is a culture of positive reinforcement, support, and a strong emphasis on building a ‘glocal’ mindset.

### No Glass Ceiling

Radixweb believes that gender stereotypes belong in the recycle bin. The world is now awake to the strength and perseverance of women.

Radixweb understands that in every social setup, a woman must possess the equal, if not greater, emotional availability as a man. This is why we make sure that our ladies are provided with all the flexibility and opportunities their male counterparts get. Radixweb is proud to state that it sports a strong female quotient in the directorial board and senior management.
