# About Radix

## Company profile

Established in 1980, Radix is one of India's foremost players in the field of Industrial Process Instrumentation and Automation. Starting out as a 2-man team in Bombay in 1980, Radix has now grown to over 260 employees without taking on a single rupee of debt, on the back of unmatched design and development strength coupled with pragmatic investment in growth. Our sales-force and products and services are currently found all over India as well as the highly-discerning German and European markets.

In addition to our decades of experience in manufacturing sensors and process-instrumentation, we have recently added a system-integration capacity and begun constructing control panels. As of now, we offer complete end-to-end automation, made cost-effective by in-house manufacture.

Over the years, we have maintained the finest design competency, a meticulous control over quality and a customer-centric business model. We understand the value of repeat business and focus on keeping our customers satisfied. We believe it is better to lose money than to lose trust.


## WHY RADIX

- If you seek superior customized sensors, feature-rich process controllers and high-quality system-integration that pays back, you have found the right company

- Every one of Radix's processes, internal or external has the common goal of improving efficiency.
