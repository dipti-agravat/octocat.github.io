Angular JS was launched by google in 2010. Now almost a decade later, the framework has become one of the world’s most sought-after software development frameworks. Angular JS’s popularity is twofold-it is a highly efficient framework that facilitates the building of dynamic and highly responsive web apps and SPAs.

Secondly, it has integration capabilities that support a wide array of tools and plugins that make the development process smooth and easy, without any compromises in output quality, be it utilities and features or visual appeal.

### Why AngularJS?

Angular JS is built on the foundation that declarative code is a must-have to create a user interface and link software components to the said interface. It also states that imperative code is much more viable while defining business logic.

Angular JS is known for its shallow learning curve, which guides developers throughout their web development journey right from UI design, business logic scripting, testing, and final delivery.

Some of Angular JS’s USPs are-

- Detailed Initialization Code

You would require numerous lines of code to acquire a simple ‘hello’ as an output in any other development framework. Thanks to AngularJS, your web applications can be easily bootstrapped by utilizing the tools mentioned above, automatically injected into the app in a Guice dependency injection format. This means that developers can build the required features faster while acquiring complete control over the initialization of mechanized tests.

-Call-Back Registration

Call-back registration helps by decreasing JavaScript coding significantly, thus easing comprehension of what the app is meant to do.
Data Organization to and from UI

In most AJAX applications, CRUD functions are a major task. With AngularJS, all the boilerplate code generated during data transferences, validation errors, and interior model integration is erased, leaving highly efficient and easily understandable code that effectively defines the application.

Top Angular JS Development Tools in 2022 and Beyond

The question that now arises is, what makes Angular JS so effective as a software development framework? The answer, Angular JS dev tools. Here’s our list of the top Angular JS development tools that facilitate hyper-effective web app development in 2022 and beyond.


1. Karma

Angularjs Development Tool - Karma

Karma is a QA and testing framework which happens to lead the list of AngularJS performance testing tools. The USP of Karma is that it allows developers to test their code in a true-to-life ecosystem.

Development professionals deploy Karma to test their products on actual devices and browsers instead of simulations. This ‘on-ground testing’ capability of Karma helps developers rapidly identify potential issues, bugs, and glitches compared to a simulated/lab setting.


2. Angular JS UI

Angularjs UI

Angular JS UI is a set of UI components built in Angular. These components can be used as building blocks to create an entire application with minimal code required from developers. These UI components are the primary reason why Angular JS development is so popular. Easily one of the best Angular JS development tools, Angular JS UI facilitates the rapid design and delivery of Angular JS applications.


3. Ment.io

Ment.io - Angularjs Development Tools

Ment.io’s USP is its ability to function independently without jQuery integration. This offers development teams unmatched levels of flexibility, allowing them to apply Ment.io to specific code blocks directly and accept selectable text input. Ment.io can also introduce macros widgets and mentions, thus further enhancing efficacy and cutting down on developer effort, making Ment.io on of the most highly desired Angular JS development tools.


4. Jasmine

Jasmine – Angularjs Development Tools

Jasmine is yet another full-fledged testing framework that makes our list of Angular JS tools. Jasmine’s aligned configuration removes the need for developers to rely on browsers or other JavaScript testing environments. Jasmine is minimalistic and sports an easy-to-use syntax that offers high levels of developer convenience while testing code. Jasmine works best while testing Node.js code and on websites that support JavaScript runtimes, making Jasmine one of the primary Angular devtools.


5. Restangular

Angular JS Development Tools – Restangular

Restangular is an app service that powers commands like GET, POST, DELETE and UPDATE, with minimal code requirements. Restangular is perfect for web applications that require data consumption from RESTful APIs, making the entire process a lot more streamlined while enhancing app performance. Restangular is considered one of the most commonly used Angular JS development tools.


6. Protractor

Protractor – Angular JS Development Tool

Another frontrunner in our list of the best Angular development tools, Protractor, is an end-to-end testing framework. Protractor stands out in the crowd of Angular JS testing frameworks because it can autonomously sync the web page being worked upon with the testing sessions as soon as the runtime ends. This offers a true-to-life testing ecosystem experience.


7. Angular-gettext

Angular Gettext Tool

Newbie developers find angular-gettext the perfect tool for code translations in Angular JS. Angular-gettext is deployed by developers to efficiently translate annotated blocks of code written in natural language into browser/framework comprehensible instructions seamlessly.
